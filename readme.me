## TTY via `%lick`  (`urTTY`)

This is a repo with a collection of tools necessary to funnel a shell on a ship's host through a fakezod's %lick vane to allow shell access to the host via urbit webapp.

On init by the client urbit app, the backend app creates a shell process. Byte arrays are b64'd and wrapped in json, then passed from the process output into a unix socket in the pier directory. The urbit app uses %lick to pass data between the frontend and backend, and the frontend displays data using `xterm.js`; commands from the client are similarly encoded and passed to the backend, which passes them into the TTY.

### Usage

- Build the frontend: `cd urtty-fe && npm build`
    - 
- Run the backend: `cd urtty-be && go run main.go`
- Install app: Boot a fakezod, `|new-desk %urtty`, `|mount %urtty`, copy the contents of `urtty-desk` into the directory, then `|commit %urtty`,
